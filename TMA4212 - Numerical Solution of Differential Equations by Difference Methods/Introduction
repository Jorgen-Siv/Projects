Project 1: 

This paper is a study into both the mathematical foundations, 
as well as implementations of numerical approximations of the Poisson heat equation, 
using finite difference schemes for elliptic 2-D problems in complex domains. 
We will also delve into the related issues, like problems one might run into during the implementation, 
and the error of the approximations.


Project 2:

We consider a 1D stationary model for the diffusion and convection of a fluid in a tube.
For this we use a boundary condition problem with a differential equation (1) similar to
the Poisson equation, obtained by combining laws for conservation of mass, Fick’s law and
Reynold’s theorem.
−∂x(α(x)∂xu + ∂xb(x)u + c(x)u = f (x) (1)
The solution u represents the concentration of the fluid at any given point x in the span
of the tube, denoted as the domain Ω ∈ (0, 1). At each edge, there is no fluid present, and
our boundary conditions are therefore u(0) = u(1) = 0. The analytical solution u is part
of the infinite dimensional Hilbert space H1
0 (0, 1), with our numerical approximation uh
being in the discrete subspace uh ∈ Vh = X1
h(0, 1) ∩ H1
0 (0, 1). In addition to numerically
approximating the solution of problem (1), related mathematical matters such as solution
uniqueness, error analysis and the convergence rate of the scheme will be explored.
