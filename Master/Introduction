In a world that demands more and more energy, there is a need for developments within renewable, clean energy. 
An example of a recent development is Floating Photo-Voltaic (FPVs), i.e floating solar cells. 
Especially there has been a focus on multi-modular structures since they allow for flexibility and simplicity in scaling. 
A big challenge for this structure and FPVs in general is the effect of environmental forces and how the dynamics of the structure interacts with these forces. 
To minimize the effect and response dynamics of the structure, controllable connectors and dampers are installed to be able to alter the dynamics of the system as needed. 
Determining the stiffness and damping that is best for a given sea state can be described as an optimization problem subjected to physical constraints, for example saturation in the connectors. 
Furthermore, one can find an optimal control algorithm to find the optimal stiffness or damping. 
However, there are potential challenges with this approach, such as the high number of variables, particularly the amount of connectors that must be optimized.
Therefore, there is a need to improve current methods or establish new methods of optimal control.
Another challenge that will affect the process of improving methods will be the real-time constraint for the controller.
